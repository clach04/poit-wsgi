-----------------------------
REQUIREMENTS AND INSTALLATION
-----------------------------
poit requires python-2.6 with python-openid-2.x.x installed.
python-openid can be obtained from http://openidenabled.com/python-openid/

poit runs under any standard CGI environment, and is designed to work with
suEXEC or any equivalent.  Although not strictly required, running poit as
a standard user is _highly_ recommended as configuration and cache data
default to being stored in '~/.config' and '~/.cache', respectively.

To install poit, simply copy poit.py to a location where it will be executed
as a CGI script.

Optionally install the poit.css stylesheet file in the same directory, or in
a location of your choice.  See poit.conf.example on configuring the stylesheet
location.

-----------------------
SETUP AND CONFIGURATION
-----------------------

Setup

Simply copy poit.py into a location where .py files are executed as CGI scripts,
and use its location as an OpenID 1.1 endpoint URL.


By default, poit requires a configuration file located at '~/.config/poit.conf'.
If it is not found there, '~/.poit.conf' and './poit.conf' are then chcked,
in that order.

poit.py can also be executed on the command line as a configuration tool.

To create an initial configuration, execute poit.py from the command line
and specify a new identity and passphrase. For example, to use
http://mydomain.tld/ as your identity, run:


    ./poit.py --add-identity=http://mydomain.tld --passphrase

See
    ./poit.py --help
for all valid options.

Not all options are configurable using the command line tool, and must be
done with a text editor.  See poit.conf.example for more information.

Once you have a configuration file, go to the location poit was installed to
in a browser and log in with your passphrase.  If it was configured correctly,
your poit install is now ready to be used as an OpenID server.

For instructions on setting up an OpenID identity to use a specific OpenID
server, please consult your favourite Internet Search Engine.

(I may write a guide of my own in the future and reference it here)

UI CUSTOMIZATION
